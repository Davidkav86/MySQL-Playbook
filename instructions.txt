Playbook for the setup of a MySQL cluster

The correct public ip addresses of the servers must be added to the inventory file

The correct public or local ip addresses must be added to each of the following files
I use local but nodes may not always be on the same subnet

1) roles/mgmt-node/defaults/main.yml
2) roles/sql-node/defaults/main.yml
3) roles/data-node/defaults/main.yml

The correct .pem file must be specified in the ansible.cfg file
